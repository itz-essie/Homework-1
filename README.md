Horiseon 

For this assignment, I began with adding comments in order to seperate the various sections of the webpage. 

I then added alt text next to images in order to make the page more accessible. I also changed many of the HTML tags in order to include symantic HTML such as adding aside, article, and section tags. 

I also fixed the html code in order to make sure all links are working properly. Initially the search engine optimization link did not work, so I had to add an ID. 

For the CSS stylesheet, there was a lot of unnecessary code that could be combined together in order to make the overall look cleaner and shorter.
